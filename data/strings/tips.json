It's the least they can do. My shadow only has room for one. Me. The dockyards are vast however.\n\n - the Zephyr Hermit"},

Just Our Old Hermit's ramblings as he calls them. Just need a storage upgrade STC, not one hand delivered. Wonder if he was a fan in hiding...\n\n- One of the Many He's an AI stories..."},
