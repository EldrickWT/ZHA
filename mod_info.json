List of -STOLEN- Assets for this SELF ONLY project: Black Rock Drive Yards for the Fury Torpedo and it's option line (3 weapons, one launcher, and 1 projectile heavily modified in code but not art). I also used the primary launcher for all three sizes of a second set of three missile/weapon systems, and again the torpedo for the system's projectile. Neutrino Corp for various Fighter Art ie neutrino_falken.png which I mirrored, recolored and plastered in 3 places because adaptable Veritech Art might not exist without skills I don't possess for a SELF ONLY project like this. FPE for the Mintz line which at the time of snagging was the level of vicious I was looking to edit the Tachyon Lance into, and in snagging removed some steps. Especially the change in java file location. I'd have bashed my brains out on that wall.",
