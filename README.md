# ZHA
Zephyr Hermit Arms - A place for ZHA and it's Imports for StarSector (Some content is actually mine... amazing, but if I don't back things up... kersplat. I do not want that egg on my face.)

Be sure to read the Imports.MD file for self flaggelation, and where all what all came from. Bring a prospector's sifter and a flour sifter as well to find the nuggets of real data amidst the ***Linguistic Linguine***.
