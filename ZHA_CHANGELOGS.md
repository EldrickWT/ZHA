#ZHA_CHANGELOGS.md

2f and you get the first changelog. SHOULD be the first of many.
Let's start this kindling.

Summary:
2e -Added the Flare PD Support Drone. Cosmetics...
2f -Fixed Silent Nex Requirement. Cosmetics. Discreet Weapons.

2e
I saw a ship error... couldn't find it. Whole mod tree. No sign.

Just where is and what is flare.ship? Why isn't it in a ship csv?
OH! Vanilla's original name for the Flash... but not a bomber.

IDEA!

So the Flare PD Support was born. Granted that's back in 2e... but
logs is plural. So might as well backpropagate one entry.

Not just a fighter or an interceptor... support!

2f
Oh. Oh heck. So much silently depended on Nexerelin subtly
on the system gen side of things. If you saw my edits to
the unincluded Calvera mod... you'd face palm. As I didn't
have some elements in that mod (repeats x.X), and was unwilling
to fullscale yank... kaboom if Nex and its rework of the sector
layer weren't directly involved.

2f stands for 2 FAIL. And worst part? I had no clue things
were busted. Never stripped the modlist down. Laid things out
as bare as possible.

Like how normal people play.

I was fixated on how borked other things were...
unhidden ports...
wrong colored engines...

Still fighting port covers.

But should be golden now. Not the covers... but setting the
situation in Calvera to a vanilla faction solved everything.

Gross seeing Pirates shipping from Calvera but eh.

I changed some things around on the offchance say... import
sources change numbers around. Or a laser color. Or entire
sprite. So starting with yrxp_, they are now yrxp_i_ to
also show it's imported content. Others should follow,
but port covers :/
