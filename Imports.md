Greetings to all who have unfortunately found themselves staring at their Content in this mod.

This is on github primarily to backup my efforts so they are not lost in an ever imminent
system loss. I can enumerate more /excuses/ but I did not ask for any of these 'Imports'.

At the end of the day that is what matters. I could be sending this by pidgeon level bandwidth.
Doesn't matter. Nor does it matter if I can't ask -source has not been on the forums for
2 years. Irrelevant.

So I intend to at least ennumerate what I got from where to the best of my ability. AND endeavor
to find freely available, Legitimate Imports, as soon as able. Or kitbash.

From the mod_info file:
"A weird little mod pack with some TWEAKED weapons from other authors."
Some to cheat weapon specifications...
"List of -STOLEN- Assets for this SELF ONLY project: Black Rock Drive Yards for the Fury Torpedo and it's
option line (3 weapons, one launcher, and 1 projectile heavily modified in code but not art). I also used
the primary launcher for all three sizes of a second set of three missile/weapon systems, and again
the torpedo for the system's projectile."

and don't forget the plasma boom. learned how to sounds.json from their work.
Oh and the shader files. Almost forgot those. The BRDY list becomes yikes fast.

"Neutrino Corp for various Fighter Art ie neutrino_falken.png which I mirrored, recolored and
plastered in 3 places because adaptable Veritech Art might not exist without skills I don't possess for
a SELF ONLY project like this."

3. 3 I said. Ha. std, wld, sxy... then also the 2 wings... so thats 5. And if you check out the title
screen and sim opponents files... practically everything is listed as... Neutrino's own opponent and title
varients were a tad... anemic. (Nothing fancy with the *_vanilla varients. Those just don't have *SpawnEmpArc*
hullmods, weapons, etc... or much of anything for **safety**)

Who do I have to blame for all this asset theft?

SELF ONLY

"FPE for the Mintz line which at the time of snagging"

First Persean Empire had just nerfed the Mintz Line... I used the pre-nerf... again for the
viciousness I'm about to mention...

"was the level of vicious I was looking to edit the Tachyon Lance into, and"

And I'd never have figured out enough at the time on my own... I could do it */now/*
but that's neither here nor there.

"in snagging removed some steps. Especially the change in java file location. I'd have
bashed my brains out on that wall."

Gotta love those location changes that don't break until something is triggered... and Janino vomits.
Because it didn't noticed on the 'serving tray' of classes and files. 9.9

Yuri Expedition... so many things. An entire ship system, sounds, projectiles,

And the ship it was on. Art not even pixeled off. The mirroring looked just so wrong to me, and
I was growing impatient to be done back in 2019. These were my theft chains and I wanted to
at least hear them jangle properly and pull and tug at my soul.

Just files in a directory, don't eat at you to swap them out hard enough.

And in a zeal to Collect Them All... even their itsy smol Valkyrie is represented on the theft board.

Jangle Jangle. =.=

Speaking of Ship Systems... How about the Hullmods that now have clones...?

We've got Disassemble Reassemble's recon mod, because I'm a fiend for hull mods.
HHE's missile reload gave me IDEAS. So even though I made my own version... I do not
yet have my own art asset for it... so if I'm using the icon... might as well
carry the chain of the hullmod clone as well.

**Hot Damn this guy loves being a martyr...**

I am enumerating my crimes. And I'm big on self loathing. Any 'Oh woe is me' is directed
at myself and I sneer back at the miserable wretch moping. And put another chain on *It*.

Speaking of chains... where were we? Hullmods...

Some more Yuri Expedition items...

And in my 'hull_mod_inclusion_base.txt' file you can see other mods that didn't make the 'Imports'
list due to complexity (Hi Fringe Defense Syndicate... your mod never leaves my loadout just
for the Astromechs alone. I'd thought to yank them from your mod, and put them in a mini mod
with just them, their economy, industry, hull mods etc... must protect cool droids...
but no SRC so... no dice.) or just "Oh hell. I'm getting so tired typing up clones ***NPE*** and
finding something busted... x.X"

And for some things you gotta clone because... the mod they're from hasn't updated, or has
updated so far beyond me that... we're back to complexity

Droids... Droids everywhere. X.x

But cloning is theft, so yay I didn't snag anything else.

Looking at Neutrino and Sylphon for... both.

Galaxy Tigers... dodged the theft bullet. Love having the whole mod around.
Same for Ship and Weapon Pack... and both are likely so far from what I'm used to from 2019.

TSC lucked out and was just too rich for my sanity to try to take out of my train wreck of mods.
I'll have to enable the mod for those hullmod goodies...

And I'm shocked that I'm done. Happy there's not more stolen crap to be sure. But it really
felt like so much more. Probably the whole 2 separate installations (2019 and 2023), and now 3 directories
for my Zephyr Hermit Arms... And Assets Pilfering (2019, 2023, and GitHub). Just shadow clones of more chains.

"uwutorpedo" where did I find you...

Drawing a blank.

Can't even recall where the Uwu comes from. That's probably stolen too. 9.9 I should learn some sea shanties.
SMH at myself. Jangle harder. Dance jester dance. Ha ha! Your feather duster bit you. Jangle you cerulean scum.
Stop landing on the Jester bird. He's got work to do. Back to your regular perch.

-Oh. OH! Jailer Self should I go test?

=Yes Jester Self. Better not have botched anything. In the real morning. To the fire shed to sleep for you.

-Oh. Joy.

=You could sleep in the rain...

-It is a dry heat.


ADDENDUMS (02/01/2024)
So Neutrino Corp got it's veritech art from HELMUT so that's where the praise goes. YRXP got their veritech
from HELMUT as well. More of a Macross:DYRL vibe with that design.

WHEN I add a star system TO this mod, I'll have my friend Alluvian Est-Endrati to thank for script notes.
No separate economy files etc etc etc for his method. All java and one file with a crapload of imports.

And I'll be less likely to mess something up. Well celestial elements'll be bug city knowing me. But I'll
only have myself to blame.
